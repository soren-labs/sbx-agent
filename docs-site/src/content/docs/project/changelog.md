## Unified architecture (current)

SBX is built around a single domain model and a single API.

- **Sessions** are the durable unit of work; compute is a replaceable
  ExecutorLease, and the Worktree survives lease replacement through
  checkpoints.
- **One API** under `/api`, with a generated OpenAPI document, typed Console
  client, Python SDK and CLI sharing one event journal and watermark.
- **PostgreSQL** is the only business authority; slow effects run as fenced Jobs.
- **Connections** are one model for inference API keys, Modal and GitHub, with
  encrypted, versioned credentials. Inference is bring-your-own-key and
  independent of the coding CLI.
- **ChangeSets, Deliveries and Delegations**: immutable subjects, exact-subject
  merge gate and generic child Sessions with validated ResultContracts.
- **Harnesses**: OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code, Grok Build and Command Code run
  as official CLIs on your inference key; others are disabled.

Not available yet: preview origins, OAuth acquisition for Connections and a
WebSocket terminal (terminals poll).
